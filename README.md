React Remix Quiz Builder
A React Remix application that allows admins to build interactive quizzes using a drag-and-drop grid system and users to participate in the configured quizzes. This application utilizes Remix Loaders and Actions for backend communication, React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

Features
1. Snap Grid System
A grid canvas where components (Progress Bar, Question Number, Timer, Question Text, Image, and Options) snap to predefined positions.
Saved configurations are persisted to the backend.
2. Admin View
A left-side navigation drawer with draggable elements.
Admins can drag-and-drop components onto the grid to configure the quiz.
Configurations are saved via Remix Actions.
3. User View
Loads the quiz layout and configuration using Remix Loaders.
Provides an interactive quiz experience, allowing users to answer questions and validate their responses.
4. Backend Integration
Mock or real backend to persist and fetch quiz configurations.
5. Responsive Design
The grid and navigation drawer are optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
6. Accessibility
Full keyboard navigation and focus management for accessible drag-and-drop interactions.

Extending the System
1. Beyond Quizzes: Supporting Forms or Lessons
This system can be extended to handle other types of content:

Forms:

Add components like input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and submit buttons.
Modify the grid to handle form validation and submission actions.
Backend to store form templates and user responses.
Lessons:

Add media components (videos, slides, text blocks).
Include interactivity like quizzes or embedded links.
Enhance the grid to support sequential navigation (e.g., "Next Lesson").



 Lazy Loading Components
To improve performance, implement lazy loading for the navigation drawer:

Approach:
Use Intersection Observer API or React hooks like useRef and useEffect to detect when the user scrolls near the bottom of the drawer.
Fetch additional components dynamically and append them to the drawer.


<!-- import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const Sidebar: React.FC = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(["Progress Bar", "Question Text", "Timer"]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);

  const loadMoreItems = () => {
    setPage((prev) => prev + 1);
    setItems((prev) => [
      ...prev,
      `Component ${prev.length + 1}`,
      `Component ${prev.length + 2}`,
    ]);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      (entries) => {
        if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
          loadMoreItems();
        }
      },
      { threshold: 1.0 }
    );
    const target = document.querySelector("#load-more");
    if (target) observer.observe(target);

    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="w-64 bg-gray-200 p-4 overflow-auto h-screen">
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <div key={index} className="p-2 bg-blue-300 rounded cursor-pointer">
          {item}
        </div>
      ))}
      <div id="load-more" className="h-8"></div>
    </div>
  );
}; -->
